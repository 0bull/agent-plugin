# Post to TikTok with 0bull

0bull rents real iPhones by the month. A post is published by driving the TikTok app on one
of those phones, so publishing is asynchronous: you queue a submission and poll it until it
reaches a final status.

## Before you start

The 0bull MCP server (`https://0bull.net/mcp`) must be connected and signed in with the
user's 0bull account. Setup for each agent is in this plugin's README and at
https://docs.0bull.net/mcp/connecting.

If `list-accounts-tool` is missing, stop and tell the user to connect the 0bull MCP server and sign in, as described in the setup above. You
are authorized as that user, so you only ever see their accounts and phones.

## Publish a video

1. **Pick the account.** Call `list-accounts-tool` with `platform: "tiktok"` and use the
   account's `id` as `account_id`. If several accounts match what the user described, ask
   which one rather than guessing. A TikTok account is bound to a phone slot, and one slot
   holds up to four TikTok accounts.
2. **Provide the video** through exactly one of:
   - `video_url`: a public https URL the server downloads.
   - `upload_id`: call `create-upload-url-tool` (no parameters), then POST or PUT the raw
     video to the returned `upload_url` within 15 minutes, then pass the `upload_id`.

   Supplying both, or neither, is rejected.
3. **Write the caption** with the user, never invented on their behalf. It is optional and
   holds up to 2200 characters.
4. **Queue it.** Call `create-submission-tool` with `platform: "tiktok"`, `account_id`, the
   video and the `caption`. Add `draft: true` to save it in the TikTok app instead of
   posting. The call returns the submission immediately in `pending`; nothing is live yet.
5. **Poll** `get-submission-tool` with the returned `submission_id`. Publishing a real video
   takes minutes, so leave a second or two between calls.

## Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `scheduled` | Queued for a future run. |
| `pending` | Queued, not picked up yet. |
| `ingesting` | The video is being fetched or prepared. |
| `driving` | The phone is being driven through the TikTok app. |
| `published` | Posted. Final. |
| `drafted` | Saved as a draft on the phone. Final. |
| `failed` | The run failed. Final. |
| `cancelled` | Cancelled before finishing. Final. |

Report the final status plainly. Never say a video is live before the status says
`published`.

## When something goes wrong

- **It stays in one status.** Look at the phone: `phone-snapshot-tool` for the account's
  slot shows what the screen is doing. A login wall or a stuck dialog is obvious in the
  picture.
- **Stop it early.** `cancel-submission-tool` works while it is `pending`, `ingesting` or
  `driving`. Once a status is final, use `delete-submission-tool` instead.
- **"Account not found".** The id belongs to another platform or another user. Check that
  you passed a TikTok account id.
- **The account has no phone assigned.** The call is refused until one is.
- **Calls start failing in bursts.** The limit is 250 requests a minute.

## Do not

- Do not call `start-rental-tool` or `request-phones-tool`. Those spend the user's money.
  If more phones are needed, say so and let the user go to https://0bull.net.
- Do not retry a failed submission automatically. A failure usually means the phone needs
  attention, and a retry posts twice.

For YouTube Shorts, use the `0bull-youtube-post` skill: the title rules are different.
